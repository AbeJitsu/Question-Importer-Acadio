Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.3,The concept of market value is best described as,"the price a buyer will pay for a property, assuming other similar properties are within the same price range","the price an informed, unhurried seller will charge for a property assuming a reasonable period of exposure with other competing properties","the price a buyer and seller agree upon for a property assuming stable interest rates, appreciation rates, and prices of other similar properties","the price that a willing, informed, and unpressured seller and buyer agree upon for a property assuming a cash price and the property's reasonable exposure to the market",d,Market value is an estimate of the price at which a property will sell at a particular time. This type of value is the one generally sought in appraisals and used in brokers' estimates of value

As a result, it is difficult to find good comparables, especially for special-purpose properties. In addition, the market must be active; otherwise, sale prices lack currency and reliability"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.6,The steps in the market data approach are,"choose nearby comparables, adjust the subject for differences, estimate the value","gather relevant price data, apply the data to the subject, estimate the value","select comparable properties, adjust the comparables, estimate the value","identify previous price paid, apply an appreciation rate, estimate the value",c,"The sales comparison approach, also known as the market data approach, is used for almost all properties. Steps in the Sales Comparison Approach:  1. Identify comparable sales. 2. Compare comparables to the subject and make adjustments to comparables. 3. Weight values indicated by adjusted comparables for the final value estimate of the subject"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.7,"In the sales comparison approach, an adjustment is warranted if",the buyer obtains conventional financing for the property,the seller offers below-market seller financing,"a comparable is located in another, albeit similar neighborhood",one property has a hip roof and the other has a gabled roof,b,"The principal factors for comparison and adjustment are time of sale, location, physical characteristics, and transaction characteristics. An adjustment may be made for such differences as mortgage loan terms, mortgage assumability, and owner financing"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.8,"To complete the sales comparison approach, the appraiser",averages the adjustments,weights the comparables,discards all comparables having a lower value,identifies the subject's value as that of the nearest comparable,b,"The last step in the approach is to perform a weighted analysis of the indicated values of each comparable. The appraiser, in other words, must identify which comparable values are more indicative of the subject and which are less indicative. However, all comparables are taken into account, not simply the nearest comparable"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.9,One weakness of the cost approach for appraising market value is that,builders may not pay market value for materials or labor,market value is not always the same as what the property cost,comparables used may not have similar quality of construction,new properties have inestimable costs and rates of depreciation,b,"The limitations of the cost approach are that: the cost to create improvements is not necessarily the same as market value; and depreciation is difficult to measure, especially for older buildings"

This is an example of,curable external obsolescence,incurable economic obsolescence,functional obsolescence,physical deterioration,b,"Economic (or external) obsolescence is the loss of value due to adverse changes in the surroundings of the subject property that make the subject less desirable. Since such changes are usually beyond the control of the property owner, economic obsolescence is considered an incurable value loss"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.13,"In appraisal, loss of value in a property from any cause is referred to as",deterioration,obsolescence,depreciation,deflation,c,"Depreciation is the loss of value in an improvement over time. The loss of an improvement's value can come from any cause, such as deterioration, obsolescence, or changes in the neighborhood"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.14,The first two steps in the cost approach are to estimate the value of the land and the cost of the improvements. The remaining steps are,"estimate depreciation, subtract depreciation from cost, and add back the land value","subtract deterioration from cost, estimate land depreciation, and total the two values","estimate depreciation of land and improvements, subtract from original cost","estimate obsolescence, subtract from the cost of land and improvements",a,Steps in the Cost Approach:  1. Estimate land value. 2. Estimate reproduction or replacement cost of improvements. 3. Estimate accrued depreciation. 4. Subtract accrued depreciation from reproduction or replacement cost. 5. Add land value to depreciated reproduction or replacement cost
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.15,"The roof of a property cost $10,000. The economic life of the roof is 20 years.

Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.16,The income capitalization approach to appraising value is most applicable for which of the following property types?,Single family homes,Apartment buildings,Undeveloped land,Churches,b,"The income capitalization approach, or income approach, is used for income properties and sometimes for other properties in a rental market where the appraiser can find rental data. The approach is based on the principle of anticipation: the expected future income stream of a property underlies what an investor will pay for the property"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.17,The steps in the income capitalization approach are:,"estimate gross income, multiply times the gross income multiplier","estimate effective income, subtract tax, apply a capitalization rate","estimate net income, and apply a capitalization rate to it","estimate potential income, apply a capitalization rate to it",c,The steps are: estimate potential gross income; estimate effective gross income (potential minus vacancy and credit losses); estimate net operating income (effective minus total operating expenses); select a capitalization rate; and apply the capitalization rate. Use the formula: income ÷ cap rate = value
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.18,Net operating income is equal to,gross income minus potential income minus expenses,effective gross income minus debt service,potential gross income minus vacancy and credit loss minus expenses,effective gross income minus vacancy and credit loss,c,Effective gross income is potential gross income minus an allowance for vacancy and credit losses. Net operating income is effective gross income minus total operating expenses. Potential gross income - Vacancy & credit losses - Total operating expenses = Net operating income
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.19,"If net income on a property is $20,000 and the cap rate is 5%, the value of the property using the income capitalization method is","$100,000 ","$400,000 ","$1,000,000 ","$4,000,000 ",b,"Value = Income ÷ Cap rate. Thus, V= $40,000 ÷ .10 = $400,000"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.20,The principal shortcoming of the gross rent multiplier approach to estimating value is that,numerous expenses are not taken into account,the multiplier does not relate to the market,the method is too complex and cumbersome,the method only applies to residential properties,a,"The gross rent multiplier approach leaves many variables out of consideration such as vacancies, credit losses, and operating expenses. In addition, the appraiser must have market rental data to establish multipliers"
Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama,16.21,"If the monthly rent of a property is $3,000, and the gross rent multiplier (GRM) is 80, what is the value of the property?","$45,000 ","$240,000 ","$267,000 ","$288,000 ",b,"GRM x Subject monthly rent = estimated value. 80 x $3,000 = $240,000"
