An important distinction between a contract for deed and a contract for sale is,a contract for deed requires no action on the part of the seller,a contract for deed requires no action on the part of the buyer,the seller retains legal title in a contract for deed transaction until fully executed,the buyer acquires legal title in a contract for deed transaction,3,PREP-AL-STD-14.14,"A contract for deed is a bilateral agreement between a seller, the vendor, and a buyer, the vendee, in which the vendor defers receipt of some or all of the purchase price of a property over a specified period of time. During the period, the vendor retains legal title and the vendee acquires equitable title. The vendee takes possession of the property, makes stipulated payments of principal and interest to the vendor, and otherwise fulfills obligations as the contract requires. At the end of the period, the buyer pays the vendor the full purchase price and the vendor deeds legal title to the vendee"
"While a property is under a contract for deed, the seller, or vendor, mortgages her equity in the property, and has a separate judgment lien placed on the property.

What can the vendee do in this case?",rightfully cancel the agreement and reclaim all deposits,sue the creditor for removal of the judgment lien,disclaim the lien and the mortgage due to homestead rights,comply with the contract and take legal title when its terms are fulfilled,4,PREP-AL-STD-14.15,"During the contract period, the seller may sell or assign whatever interests he or she owns in the property to another party. The vendor, however, is bound to the obligations imposed by the contract for deed. In particular, the vendor may not breach the obligation to convey legal title to the vendee upon receipt of the total purchase price"
A potential danger involved in a contract for deed is that,the vendor may rightfully sell legal title to another party during the contract period,the vendor's rights to encumber the property are extinguished,the vendee may not have a right of redemption,"the vendee must make an inordinately high down payment, which can be lost",3,PREP-AL-STD-14.16,"In some states, a breach of the contract for deed is remedied under local contract law rather than foreclosure law. The buyer may not have the protections of a redemption period or other buyer-protection laws which accompany formal foreclosure proceedings. The vendor might sue the vendee for breach of contract for the slightest infraction of the contract terms"
Price is best described as,what suppliers charge for goods and services,the amount of money consumers are willing to pay for a product or service,the amount of money a buyer and seller agree to exchange to complete a transaction,a control placed on prices by the federal government,3,PREP-AL-STD-15.1,A price is the amount of money or other asset that a buyer has agreed to pay and a seller has agreed to accept to complete the exchange of a good or service. It is a quantification of the value of an item traded
Four principal determinants of value underlying the price for a product are,"durability, quality, scarcity, and materials","desire, utility, scarcity, and purchasing power","popularity, utility, quality, and discount","desire, costs, convenience, and time",2,PREP-AL-STD-15.2,The value of something is based on the answers to four questions:  •How much do I desire it?  •How useful is it?  •	How scarce is it?  •Am I able to pay for it?
"A town has a rapidly growing population, but there are no longer any vacant lots around the lake to build more houses. In this case, it is likely that the price of existing homes on the lake","will stabilize, since the population must stabilize",will increase,"will decline, since no further building can take place",will not show any predictable movement,2,PREP-AL-STD-15.3,"The third critical element of value is a product's availability in relation to demand. The air conditioner is quite valuable if there are only five units in the entire city and everyone is hot. On the other hand, the value of an air conditioner goes down if there are ten thousand units for sale in a 500-person market"
"If there is a significant undersupply of homes in a market, construction will tend to increase. This is an example of",supply outstripping demand,overpricing products,the price mechanism,the market tending toward equilibrium,4,PREP-AL-STD-15.4,"A market tends toward a state of equilibrium in which supply equals demand, and price, cost, and value are identical. Thus if supply is scarce, construction will increase to stabilize the imbalance"
"If commercial real estate rental prices are falling in a market, it is likely that",demand has outstripped supply of space,the market is in equilibrium,the market is over-supplied,employment is increasing,3,PREP-AL-STD-15.5,"Falling prices indicate an oversupply of commercial properties in relation to demand. In this case, construction of new supply will also slow down"
Which of the following is an important economic characteristic of real estate?,The demand must literally come to the supply,Real estate is a highly liquid product,The product is quick to adapt to market changes,The market is centralized,1,PREP-AL-STD-15.6,"Since real property cannot be moved, real property investors and users must come to the supply. This creates risk, because if demand drops, the supply cannot be transported to a higher demand market"
The foremost factor contributing to commercial and residential demand in a market is,marketing,base employment,existing supply of properties,household income,2,PREP-AL-STD-15.7,The engine that drives demand for real estate of all types in a market is employment. Base employment is the number of persons employed in the businesses that represent the economic foundation of the area
A construction boom in a market is an indication that prices,have been increasing,have been declining,have been in equilibrium,have exceeded supply,1,PREP-AL-STD-15.8,"A rise in prices is a market signal that there is an undersupply of product in relation to demand. As the market moves toward equilibrium, builders construct more buildings to meet the unmet demand"
A local government could stimulate the real estate market by,increasing labor costs and curbing the money supply,increasing taxes and interest rates,declaring a moratorium on construction,expanding the sewer system,4,PREP-AL-STD-15.9,"Since the real estate market is local by definition, local factors weigh heavily in local real estate market conditions. This includes the capacity of the municipality's infrastructure to handle growth"
Two important concerns of retail property users are,trade area population and spending patterns,quality of life and dwelling amenities,costs of occupancy and building efficiency,environmental regulations and access by suppliers,1,PREP-AL-STD-15.10,Retail users are concerned with:  •sufficient trade area population and income  •	the level of trade area competition  •sales volume per square foot of rented area  •consumer spending patterns  •growth patterns in the trade area
Two important concerns of office property users are,trade area population and visibility,convenience and neighborhood make-up,costs of occupancy and building efficiency,environmental regulations and zoning,3,PREP-AL-STD-15.11,Office users are concerned with:  •of occupancy to the business  •efficiency of the building and the suite in accommodating the business's functions  •accessibility by employees and suppliers  •matching building quality to the image and function of the business
"As a component of real estate value, the principle of substitution suggests that","if two similar properties are for sale, a buyer will purchase the cheaper of the two","if one of two adjacent homes is more valuable, the price of the other home will tend to rise","if too many properties are built in a market, the prices will tend to go down",people will readily move to another home if it is of equal value,1,PREP-AL-STD-16.1,"According to the principle of substitution, a buyer will pay no more for a property than the buyer would have to pay for an equally desirable and available substitute property. For example, if three houses for sale are essentially similar in size, quality and location, a potential buyer is unlikely to choose the one that is priced significantly higher than the other two"
Highest and best use of a property is that use which,"is physically and financially feasible, legal, and the most productive","is legal, feasible, and deemed the most appropriate by zoning authorities",entails the largest building that zoning ordinances will allow developers to erect,conforms to other properties in the area,1,PREP-AL-STD-16.2,"This valuation principle holds that there is, theoretically, a single use for a property that produces the greatest income and return. A property achieves its maximum value when it is put to this use. The use must however be legal"
The concept of market value is best described as,"the price a buyer will pay for a property, assuming other similar properties are within the same price range","the price an informed, unhurried seller will charge for a property assuming a reasonable period of exposure with other competing properties","the price a buyer and seller agree upon for a property assuming stable interest rates, appreciation rates, and prices of other similar properties","the price that a willing, informed, and unpressured seller and buyer agree upon for a property assuming a cash price and the property's reasonable exposure to the market",4,PREP-AL-STD-16.3,Market value is an estimate of the price at which a property will sell at a particular time. This type of value is the one generally sought in appraisals and used in brokers' estimates of value
A significant difference between an appraisal and a broker's opinion of value is,the appraiser tends to use only one or two of the approaches to value,the broker may not be a disinterested party,the broker is subject to government regulation in generating the opinion,the appraiser uses less current market data,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.4,"A broker's opinion of value may resemble an appraisal, but it differs from an appraisal in that it is not necessarily performed by a disinterested third party or licensed professional"
A notable weakness of the sales comparison approach to value is that,there may be no recent sale price data in the market,the approach is not based on the principle of substitution,"the approach is only accurate with unique, special purpose properties","sale prices cannot be compared, since all real estate is different",1,PREP-AL-STD-16.5,"The sales comparison approach is limited in that every property is unique. As a result, it is difficult to find good comparables, especially for special-purpose properties. In addition, the market must be active; otherwise, sale prices lack currency and reliability"
The steps in the market data approach are,"choose nearby comparables, adjust the subject for differences, estimate the value","gather relevant price data, apply the data to the subject, estimate the value","select comparable properties, adjust the comparables, estimate the value","identify previous price paid, apply an appreciation rate, estimate the value",3,PREP-AL-STD-16.6,"The sales comparison approach, also known as the market data approach, is used for almost all properties. Steps in the Sales Comparison Approach:  1. Identify comparable sales. 2. Compare comparables to the subject and make adjustments to comparables. 3. Weight values indicated by adjusted comparables for the final value estimate of the subject"
"In the sales comparison approach, an adjustment is warranted if",the buyer obtains conventional financing for the property,the seller offers below-market seller financing,"a comparable is located in another, albeit similar neighborhood",one property has a hip roof and the other has a gabled roof,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.7,"The principal factors for comparison and adjustment are time of sale, location, physical characteristics, and transaction characteristics. An adjustment may be made for such differences as mortgage loan terms, mortgage assumability, and owner financing"
"To complete the sales comparison approach, the appraiser",averages the adjustments,weights the comparables,discards all comparables having a lower value,identifies the subject's value as that of the nearest comparable,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.8,"The last step in the approach is to perform a weighted analysis of the indicated values of each comparable. The appraiser, in other words, must identify which comparable values are more indicative of the subject and which are less indicative. However, all comparables are taken into account, not simply the nearest comparable"
One weakness of the cost approach for appraising market value is that,builders may not pay market value for materials or labor,market value is not always the same as what the property cost,comparables used may not have similar quality of construction,new properties have inestimable costs and rates of depreciation,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.9,"The limitations of the cost approach are that: the cost to create improvements is not necessarily the same as market value; and depreciation is difficult to measure, especially for older buildings"
The cost of constructing a functional equivalent of a subject property is known as,reproduction cost,replacement cost,restitution cost,reconstruction cost,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.10,"Reproduction cost is the cost of constructing, at current prices, a precise duplicate of the subject improvements. Replacement cost is the cost of constructing, at current prices and using current materials and methods, a functional equivalent of the subject improvements"
An office building lacks sufficient cooling capability to accommodate modern computer equipment. This is an example of,physical deterioration,economic obsolescence,incurable depreciation,functional obsolescence,4,PREP-AL-STD-16.11,Functional obsolescence occurs when a property has outmoded physical or design features which are no longer desirable to current users
A home is located in a neighborhood where homeowners on the block have failed to maintain their properties. This is an example of,curable external obsolescence,incurable economic obsolescence,functional obsolescence,physical deterioration,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.12,"Economic (or external) obsolescence is the loss of value due to adverse changes in the surroundings of the subject property that make the subject less desirable. Since such changes are usually beyond the control of the property owner, economic obsolescence is considered an incurable value loss"
"In appraisal, loss of value in a property from any cause is referred to as",deterioration,obsolescence,depreciation,deflation,3,PREP-AL-STD-16.13,"Depreciation is the loss of value in an improvement over time. The loss of an improvement's value can come from any cause, such as deterioration, obsolescence, or changes in the neighborhood"
The first two steps in the cost approach are to estimate the value of the land and the cost of the improvements. The remaining steps are,"estimate depreciation, subtract depreciation from cost, and add back the land value","subtract deterioration from cost, estimate land depreciation, and total the two values","estimate depreciation of land and improvements, subtract from original cost","estimate obsolescence, subtract from the cost of land and improvements",1,PREP-AL-STD-16.14,Steps in the Cost Approach:  1. Estimate land value. 2. Estimate reproduction or replacement cost of improvements. 3. Estimate accrued depreciation. 4. Subtract accrued depreciation from reproduction or replacement cost. 5. Add land value to depreciated reproduction or replacement cost
"The roof of a property cost $10,000. The economic life of the roof is 20 years. Assuming the straight-line method of depreciation, what is the depreciated value of the roof after 3 years?","$10,000","$8,500","$7,000","$1,500",2,PREP-AL-STD-16.15,"$10,000 / 20 years * 17 years = $8,500"
The income capitalization approach to appraising value is most applicable for which of the following property types?,Single family homes,Apartment buildings,Undeveloped land,Churches,2,PREP-AL-STD-16.16,"The income capitalization approach, or income approach, is used for income properties and sometimes for other properties in a rental market where the appraiser can find rental data. The approach is based on the principle of anticipation: the expected future income stream of a property underlies what an investor will pay for the property"
The steps in the income capitalization approach are:,"estimate gross income, multiply times the gross income multiplier","estimate effective income, subtract tax, apply a capitalization rate","estimate net income, and apply a capitalization rate to it","estimate potential income, apply a capitalization rate to it",3,PREP-AL-STD-16.17,The steps are: estimate potential gross income; estimate effective gross income (potential minus vacancy and credit losses); estimate net operating income (effective minus total operating expenses); select a capitalization rate; and apply the capitalization rate. Use the formula: income ÷ cap rate = value
Net operating income is equal to,gross income minus potential income minus expenses,effective gross income minus debt service,potential gross income minus vacancy and credit loss minus expenses,effective gross income minus vacancy and credit loss,3,PREP-AL-STD-16.18,Effective gross income is potential gross income minus an allowance for vacancy and credit losses. Net operating income is effective gross income minus total operating expenses. Potential gross income - Vacancy & credit losses - Total operating expenses = Net operating income
"If net income on a property is $20,000 and the cap rate is 5%, the value of the property using the income capitalization method is","$100,000","$400,000","$1,000,000","$4,000,000",2,PREP-AL-STD-16.19,"Value = Income ÷ Cap rate. Thus, V= $40,000 ÷ .10 = $400,000"
The principal shortcoming of the gross rent multiplier approach to estimating value is that,numerous expenses are not taken into account,the multiplier does not relate to the market,the method is too complex and cumbersome,the method only applies to residential properties,1,PREP-AL-STD-16.20,"The gross rent multiplier approach leaves many variables out of consideration such as vacancies, credit losses, and operating expenses. In addition, the appraiser must have market rental data to establish multipliers"
"If the monthly rent of a property is $3,000, and the gross rent multiplier (GRM) is 80, what is the value of the property?","$45,000","$240,000","$267,000","$288,000",2,PREP-AL-STD-16.21,"GRM x Subject monthly rent = estimated value. 80 x $3,000 = $240,000"
"A certain house has, in addition to the main house, an unfinished but heated basement where the family’s adult son lives; a finished but unheated attic with sloped ceilings are seven feet in height at the ridge, that is used as a child’s playroom; a two-car garage that is attached to the main house but not heated; and a large interior central stairwell providing access to the second floor. Which of these spaces would be considered part of Gross Living Area under ANSI and Fannie Mae standards?",The basement,The garage,The attic,The stairwell,4,PREP-AL-STD-16.22,Both stair and closets areas are generally fully countable in gross living area.
A homeowner borrows money from a lender and gives the lender a mortgage on the property as collateral for the loan. The homeowner retains title to the property. This is an example of,intermediation,forfeiture,hypothecation,subordination,3,PREP-AL-STD-17.1,The process of securing a loan by pledging a property without giving up ownership of the property is called hypothecation
Which of the following best expresses the mechanics of a mortgage loan transaction?,The borrower gives the lender a note and a mortgage in exchange for loan funds,The lender gives the borrower a mortgage and receives a note in exchange for loan funds,The borrower receives a note in exchange for a mortgage from the lender,"The lender gives the borrower a note, loan funds and a mortgage",1,PREP-AL-STD-17.2,"Mortgagor gives note & mortgage to mortgagee, mortgagee gives loan amount to mortgagor"
"In a deed of trust transaction, which of the following occurs?",The beneficiary conveys title to a trustee in exchange for loan funds,The trustee conveys title to a beneficiary in exchange for loan funds,The trustor conveys title to a trustee in exchange for loan funds from the beneficiary,The trustee conveys title to a trustor in exchange for loan funds from the beneficiary,3,PREP-AL-STD-17.3,"A deed of trust conveys title to the property in question from the borrower (trustor) to a trustee as security for the loan. The trustee is a third party fiduciary to the trust. While the loan is in place, the trustee holds the title on behalf of the lender, who is the beneficiary of the trust"
A lender lends money to a homeowner and takes legal title to the property as collateral during the payoff period. They are in a,title-theory state,lien-theory state,state allowing land trusts,state where hypothecation is illegal,1,PREP-AL-STD-17.4,States that regard the mortgage document as a conveyance of ownership from the mortgagor to the mortgagee are called title-theory states
A lender who charges a rate of interest in excess of legal limits is guilty of,redlining,usury,profit-taking,nothing; there are no legal limits to interest rates,2,PREP-AL-STD-17.5,"Many states have laws against usury, which is the charging of excessive interest rates on loans. Such states have a maximum rate that is either a flat rate or a variable rate tied to an index such as the prime lending rate"
"A lender is charging 3 points on a $500,000 loan. The borrower must therefore pay the lender an advance amount of","$1,500","$3,000","$15,000","$30,000",3,PREP-AL-STD-17.6,"A discount point is one percent of the loan amount. Thus, one point on a $500,000 loan equals $5,000. 3 points would be $15,000. The lender charges this as pre-paid interest at closing by funding only the face amount of the loan minus the discount points. The borrower, however, must repay the full loan amount, along with interest calculated on the full amount"
The difference between a balloon loan and an amortized loan is,an amortized loan is paid off over the loan period,a balloon loan always has a shorter loan term,an amortized loan requires interest-payments,a balloon loan must be retired in five years,1,PREP-AL-STD-17.7,"Amortized loans retire the principal balance over the loan period. If a loan does not do this, one must make a balloon payment at the end of the loan term to complete the loan payoff"
A distinctive feature of a promissory note is that,it is not assignable,it must be accompanied by a mortgage,it is a negotiable instrument,it may not be prepaid,3,PREP-AL-STD-17.8,"A promissory note is a negotiable instrument, which means the payee may assign it to a third party. The assignee would then have the right to receive the borrower's periodic payments"
"When the terms of the mortgage loan are satisfied, the mortgagee",may retain any overage in the escrow account,may inspect the property before returning legal title,may be entitled to charge the borrower a small fee to close the loan,may be required to execute a release of mortgage document,4,PREP-AL-STD-17.9,"Lenders may be required to release the mortgage or trust document to the borrower when the borrower has paid off the loan and all other sums secured by the document. The release clause, also known as a defeasance clause, may specify that the mortgagee will execute a satisfaction of mortgage (also known as release of mortgage and mortgage discharge) to the mortgagor"
"In addition to income, credit, and employment data, a mortgage lender requires additional documentation, usually including",an appraisal report,a criminal record report,a subordination agreement,a default recourse waiver,1,PREP-AL-STD-17.10,Loan underwriting is the process of assessing the lender's risk in giving a loan. Mortgage underwriting includes: evaluating the borrower's ability to repay the loan; appraising the value of the property offered as security; and determining the terms of the loan
The three overriding considerations of a lender's mortgage loan decision are,"points, interest rate, and loan term","the location of the mortgaged property, the borrower's cash, and the amount of the borrower's equity","the ability to re-pay, the value of the collateral, and the profitability of the loan","the amount of the loan, the borrower's income, and the down payment",3,PREP-AL-STD-17.11,"A lender assesses risks by examining, or qualifying, both borrower and property. In qualifying a borrower, an underwriter weighs the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In qualifying a property, an underwriter assesses the ability of the property value to cover potential losses. In this evaluation, a lender requires that the appraised value of the property be more than adequate to cover the contemplated loan and costs. Finally, the loan must make money for the lending organization as a basic business precept"
"The loan-to-value ratio is an important underwriting criterion, for the primary reason that",borrowers with no equity will default and abandon the property,the lender wants to ensure the loan is fully collateralized,a borrower can only afford to borrow a portion of the entire purchase price,a fair amount of borrower equity demonstrates good faith,2,PREP-AL-STD-17.12,"In qualifying a property, an underwriter assesses the ability of the property value to cover potential losses. In this evaluation, a lender requires that the appraised value of the property be more than adequate to cover the contemplated loan and costs. To protect further against loss, a lender will usually lend only a portion of the property's value. The relationship of the loan amount to the property value, expressed as a percentage, is called the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV"
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requires lenders to,extend equal credit to all prospective borrowers,consider the income of a spouse in evaluating a family's creditworthiness,discount the income of a person involved in child-rearing or child-bearing,specialize lending activity by geographical area for improved customer service,2,PREP-AL-STD-17.13,"The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requires a lender to evaluate a loan applicant on the basis of that applicant's own income and credit rating, unless the applicant requests the inclusion of another's income and credit rating in the application. In such a case, a lender may not discount or disregard income from part-time work, a spouse, child support, alimony, or separate maintenance"
The purpose of an income ratio in qualifying a borrower is to,safeguard against over-indebtedness,compare one's earnings to one's short-term debt,identify the highest possible interest rate that the borrower can afford,quantify the borrower's assets to the fullest extent,1,PREP-AL-STD-17.14,"Lenders want to be assured that the borrower has adequate means to make all necessary periodic payments on the loan in addition to other housing expenses and debts such as credit card payments and car payments. Most lenders use two ratios to estimate an applicant's ability to fulfill a loan obligation: an income ratio, or housing ratio, and a debt ratio, or housing plus debt ratio. The income ratio, or housing expense ratio, establishes borrowing capacity by limiting the percent of gross income a borrower may spend on housing costs"
A borrower's debt ratio is derived by,dividing one's total debt by one's debt payments,dividing one's gross income by one's assets,dividing one's gross income by one's debts,dividing one's debts by one's gross income,4,PREP-AL-STD-17.15,The debt ratio formula is:  (monthly housing expense + monthly debt obligations) ÷ monthly gross income = debt ratio
A lender's commitment to lend funds to a borrower in order to retire another outstanding loan is called a,conditional loan commitment,firm loan commitment,take-out loan commitment,lock-in loan commitment,3,PREP-AL-STD-17.16,"A take-out commitment offers to make a loan that will ""take out"" another lender's loan, i.e., pay it off and replace it. The take-out loan is most often used to retire a construction loan. The take-out lender agrees to pay off the short-term construction loan by issuing a long-term permanent loan"
At the closing of a mortgage loan,the borrower pays off the note and receives clear title,the lender issues a firm loan commitment,the parties complete all loan origination documents and the loan is funded,the borrower's loan application is complete and the file closed,3,PREP-AL-STD-17.17,"Closing of a mortgage loan normally occurs with the closing of the real estate transaction.
